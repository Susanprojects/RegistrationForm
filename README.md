# SignUpForm

This project creates a single page app with a Sign up/ Registration form so that users can register themselves and was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.5.

It includes :

1. Creation of form fields like first name, last name, email and password.
2. Custom validations for each of the form fields.
3. post API service call to submit the form data when user clicks on the submit button.
4. Bootstrap css file for styling.

Improvements/Pending :

1. A confirm password field can be added for security and proper validation of the password field.
2. Error related to form fields in the html(shown in terminal)
3. Test cases for the components
